# Note about dependencies.

The `nativescript-dev-webpack` plugin adds a few devDependencies to the project. Make sure to run either `npm install` or `yarn` after installing the plugin.
The versions of the newly added packages depend on the versions of some of your already added packages. More specifically - `tns-core-modules` and all packages from the `@angular` scope. Since version 0.4.0, nativescript-dev-webpack will automatically add the correct development dependencies, based on what you already have installed.
You can force update your `package.json` using the `update-ns-webpack` script which you can find in `PROJECT_DIR/node_modules/.bin`.
If the bundling process fails, please make sure you have the correct versions of the packages.

| Main packages versions | Plugins versions
| --- | ---
| `tns-core-modules`: **^3.0.0** <br> `@angular/`: **^4.0.0** | `nativescript-angular`: **^3.0.0** <br> `@ngtools/webpack`: **^1.3.0** <br> `typescript`: **^2.2.0**
| `tns-core-modules`: **^2.5.0** <br> `@angular/`: **^4.0.0** | `nativescript-angular`: **^1.5.1** <br> `@ngtools/webpack`: **1.2.13** <br> `typescript`: **2.1.6**
| `tns-core-modules`: **^2.5.0** <br> `@angular/`: **^2.4.0** | `nativescript-angular`: **^1.4.1** <br> ``@ngtools/webpack``: **1.2.10** <br> `typescript`: **2.1.6**

P.S. Also please make sure you are using the same version of all `@angular/` packages, including the devDependency of `@angular/compiler-cli`.
